# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I am trying to learn Git and GitHub, and how to work with them through a IDE. In this case it is Visual Studio Code.
To get started I downloaded the latest version of Python on my computer. Next, I installed the Python Extension in the VS Code, so that I could run code written in python in VS Code. When my folder with a python file was ready I initialized a git repository in the source control, published it to the GitHub, committed and synced the folder.

{Provide a description of your software}
This is the most basic one-line program that says "Hello World".

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
The main purpose of this small piece of software is to practice using Git, connecting it to the VS Code, adding a folder to Git, publishing it the on GitHub in a new repository, committing, and syncing any changes made in the files. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
